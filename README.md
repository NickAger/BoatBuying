* [Westerly Griffon Twin Keel Sailing Yacht £4,495](https://westerly.apolloduck.co.uk/boat/westerly-griffon/591076) - "From what we understand from the last owners wife, she has only had two owners from new, the last being for over 25 years, during which time it was cruised extensively on the south coast of the UK, northern France and the channel islands. Sadly the owner passed away recently after a long illness, during which time the boat has been a little neglected and now needs some TLC to prepare it for next season." - "she is unusual in the sense that the interior is not a conventional Griffon layout. The galley is a little larger than usual and it has a forward facing nav station on the port side ahead of the quarterberth.", "there are lots of jobs that will need doing but she is priced accordingly and should reward any effort that is put into her."
